# calculator
A basic calculator that was built as practice for learning Swift.

Since this was practice building a responsive mobile application,
I focused on making it interactive and resizeable.  There are still bugs
in the calculator logic that need to be resolved.

Inspired by the Stanford 'Developing iOS 10 Apps with Swift' online course on iTunes.
