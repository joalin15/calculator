# calculator
A basic calculator that was built as practice for learning Swift.

Since this was mostly practice for building a responsive mobile application,
the focus was on making it interactive and resizeable.  There are still bugs
in the calculator logic that need to be resolved.

Inspired by the Stanford 'Developing iOS 10 Apps with Swift' online course on iTunes.
